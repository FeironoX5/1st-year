______
I live in Krasnogorsk, it's considered the most green area in Moscow obtast'. However, it's still a place where a lot of high-rise buildings located. Mostly people live here, because it's cheaper than Moscow, although we had two huge malls - "CROCUS" and "SNEZHKOM". The last one was disassemled by owner, and the first recently burnt. 

Right now, we have many beautiful parks, and I think that's what differences Krasnogorsk among other "grey" areas. Wouldn't those parks be a great space to develop cultured life? Imagine every park having as much self-identity as many Moscow metro stations have, and a courage to become a place for cultural events and discussions, which New Holland has. Combining these two factors may become a unique possibility for the city.

Implementing this solution shouldn't take lots of time and budget, as Krasnogorsk administration did a really great job with those parks already. First, we need to make some guidelines in order to exclude some deviations, which may lead to security and moral incidents, and then let courated designers do their job to make every park unique, then we should invite some teachers, or blogger, famous for example for chess to hold events lets say, once a week, and the final step will be advertising new activities among people.

Two things Im scared of are shortage of cultured people in Krasnogorsk, who will teach, speak and join these activities, and untelligent people, who might steal inventories and disturb other participants.

All these steps will lead to increased rent prices, higher happiness level, and increased authority of Krasnogorsk as a Moscow oblast' "capital" city.
