# Writing 3

Write an informal message retelling the piece of news about business you’ve heard or read about (fake or real). Include your interpretation of the piece of news.

Your message should include:

- Reporting verbs (say will be treated as a mistake)
- Speculation grammar (past modals, e.g. must have, could have, etc.)
- Passive Voice and/or passive structures (is expected to, is believed to, etc.)

Write about 120-150 words.

Please, include the link to the news story your message is based on. I'm going to need the original while reading your messages. Many thanks!☀️

Recently while scrolling my YT feed I discovered VIM vs Emacs comparison video. Both of them are text editors, mostly used by programmers.

As stated in the video, the key difference is that VIM users prefer speed extending VIM to IDE over functionality, while Emacs is loved as all-included and can even be considered as a whole OS.

Then author of the article states none of these is better, which I expected as he probably doesn't want to hurt anybody. However, the guy reacting to the original video states, you should have a formed point of view rather than simple statement, and I totally agree, as original video seemed a bit pointless to me.

For me, VS Code is the best choice for now, and to code more effectively, I plan to switch to VIM during the summer, as I could not get away from it before due to lack of time.
