"Today's music is getting sadder and angrier" - that's probably said by the same person, who tells us nowadays music makes less sense, music should be discussed in wider terms. On the rights of a huge music industry fan, only thing I say with full confidence is that music with years only became more diverse.

On top of that, we saw the whole birth of new genre, called rap, and then a whole evolution into trap, rage-trap, jersey and other subgenres. At first, rap was considered basic and low-skilled music. And look where we are now, rap is the most listened genre with albums such as "My Beatiful Little Dark Twisted Fantasy", "Madvillainy", "Wild East", "M.a.a.D. City", and many more beatiful ones. Rap producers sample 40 records at one time, rappers discuss hard political topics, and form people's opinion.

Talking about sad and angry tenderntions, music as every art area, has the ability to capture the moment and the times behind it. So, as the world falls in chaos, music represents this, as the world will enter next golden era, music also will picture this.

At the end of the day, modern music is in it's most diverse and complicated state than it has ever been, inculding the past generations' experience, so everyone is able to find something valuable for him.
